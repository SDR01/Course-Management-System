# COURSE MONITORING SYSTEM

## Problem Statement 

> In an educational Institute there are several courses running parallel every day. For every course there are several batches at same/different time. Every course has a session wise/day wise schedule. It will be difficult for the Faculty Head to know the status of every batch i.e. what is the session taught at each day in a batch.
> 
> So create a Automated Course Monitoring System that will keep the records of all the courses, batches, faculties and the day wise update for every batch, which shall help the Faculty Head to maintain the course plan.
